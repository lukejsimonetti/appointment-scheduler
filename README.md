# appointment-scheduler

## Using ReactJS, NodeJS (Express framework), webpack

To start the app, simply run `npm start` after running `npm install` in the root directory. 

To run tests, run `npm test`.

## Application Requirements:
1.  Build a screen which shows a list of hour long slots from 9am to 5pm. React is preferred.
2.  When one time slot is clicked, pop up a modal which asks for name and phone number.
3.  When the name and phone number is submitted, the time slot selected should change to red, indicating the time slot is no longer available.
4.  If the red time slot is clicked on again, the modal will pop up with the name and phone number for that appointment pre-populated. Users will be able to edit the name and phone number to change the user for the appointment.
5. We should be able to install all dependencies using 'npm'
6. We should be able to use a simple editor to view the code.
